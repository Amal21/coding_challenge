# Project Name
City Management System

## Description
This project aims to create a City Management System with endpoints for managing cities. The frontend application displays a list of cities, and their locations on a map, and provides city filtering options.
The backend application handles the endpoints for cities.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend:
  - React.js

- Backend:
  - Nest.js

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Navigate to the backend folder: `cd ../backend`
5. Install backend dependencies: `yarn install`

## Folder Structure
- `frontend`: Contains the frontend application built with React.js.
- `backend`: Contains the backend application built with Nest.js.

## Usage
Start the backend server:
- Navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
- Start the server: `yarn run start`

Start the frontend application:
- Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd ../frontend`
- Start the application: `yarn start`

Access the application in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## API Documentation
This is the documentation of the endpoints with Swagger [http://localhost:8000/api/](http://localhost:8000/api/)
Request and response formats follow standard RESTful conventions.
